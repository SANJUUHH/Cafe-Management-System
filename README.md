# Cafe Management System

This is a simple Python program that simulates a cafe management system where users can order food items from a predefined menu. The system calculates the total cost of the order and provides a summary of the order along with customer details.

## Features
- Displays a menu with item prices.
- Allows customers to order up to 5 items.
- Automatically calculates the total price of the order.
- Displays a friendly message with customer details after placing an order.

## Menu
- PIZZA: Rs.120
- BURGER: Rs.80
- TEA: Rs.10
- COFFEE: Rs.20
- POHA: Rs.40

## How to Use
Run the `hotel.py` script in your Python environment. The program will guide you through placing an order.

### Example Walkthrough:
1. The customer is prompted to enter an order from the menu.
2. The program checks for the availability of the ordered item.
3. The program allows the user to order additional items (up to 5).
4. Once the order is complete, the total price is displayed, along with a thank-you message and the customer's details.
